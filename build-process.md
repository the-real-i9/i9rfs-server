# Build Process

This document narrates the build process of this application; from ideation, spans through code, decision-making, rationales, implementations, algorithms, technologies, integrations etc., finally, to deployment. It promises not to bore you with unnecessary, weird information that you would be less concerned about; only what you need to know and what I really want you to know.

Fellow developers will get the feeling of a project "tutorial" from reading this, while hiring managers, or employers in general, will get to know of my skills and thought process.
