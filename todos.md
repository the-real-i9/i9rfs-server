# ToDos

I started rethinking the whole project from scratch and I figured that I've missed the goal of the project right from the beginning. I didn't quite understand what a remote file system should be like, I had a wrong knowledge of what it is.

I'm meant to implement this application in the behaviour of cloud storage solutions like Google Drive, One Drive and GCS. So I'm gonna be rebuilding this correctly very soon.
