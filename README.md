# i9rfs (API Server)

## Intro

i9lyfe-server is an API server for a Remote File System Application, built with entirely with WebSocket in Go. It supports major file system operations that can be used to implement Cloud Storage applications, such Google Drive and One Drive.

### Who is this project for?

If you're a frontend developer looking to build an App similar to Google Drive or One Drive, not just to have it static, but to also make it function.

The API documentation provides a detailed integration guide. It doesn't follow the Open API specification, rather it follows Google's API documentation style sturcured in a simple markdown table, which I consider simple, comprehensive, flexible, and easier to follow.

### Open to suggestions

If your needs require more features than this API server currently supports, feel free to suggest them, and it will be added as soon as possible.
